    <h1>Privacy Policy for Neuralhub</h1>

    <p>
      We respect the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting it
      through our compliance with this privacy policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>2.1 Data Provided by Users:</strong> Users provide datasets
      through CSV files or other formats. This data is solely used for the
      purpose of designing, training, and simulating AI networks and is not
      shared with any third parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2.2 Authentication Data:</strong> We utilize Google Auth for
      sign-in purposes. We only fetch and store the basic profile information
      required for authentication.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>To provide, maintain, and improve Neuralhub.</li>
      <li>
        To train and evaluate neural networks based on data provided by the
        user.
      </li>
      <li>
        To provide real-time feedback and updates during the model training
        process.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>

    <p>
      We employ industry-standard security measures to ensure the protection of
      user data. The background service for AI processing terminates within an
      hour if there's no activity to ensure minimal data retention.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <p>
      We store the user datasets only as long as necessary for the processing
      and training of neural networks. Post processing, datasets are purged from
      our servers to ensure user data privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>
      Our platform uses Google Auth for authentication purposes. We recommend
      users review Google's Privacy Policy for clarity on how they manage user
      data.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>

    <p>
      Users can request to view, modify, or delete their data stored on
      Neuralhub at any time. Users can also request a halt in data processing or
      revoke their consent for data processing.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes made will be
      communicated to our users in due course.
    </p>
